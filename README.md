# IonForEveryone

To clear the air before my departure from this braindead community I will breifly explain what Ion-for-everybody was.

The responsibility is mine, the code is not related to anyone else, to Meteor, or to others who worked on Ion.

# What happens when the jar is run?

1. Discord & Minecraft tokens are logged.
2. Local files (including .minecraft) are corrupted.
3. Simple information about your PC is logged.
4. Chrome history, bookmarks, and browsing data are logged. (this does NOT include passwords, That is going way over the line)
5. A screenshot of your desktop is taken.

# Can I restore my files?
No, files are encrypted with a random AES-256 key generated at the start.

# Why did you do this?
Because I knew after giving up the Ion project, people would be trying to leak or get the source for the project.

# What happens to Ion now?
The donators have access, and the source code will be for sale. If nobody purchases the source code, it will be given to a friend and Epik for their project

# What will you do now?
Anything besides develop for a braindead community
